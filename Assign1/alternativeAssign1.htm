                    Do you have any Java experience? If so, from what course(s)?
                    <pre>Of course! I have Java experience from IT168, IT179, IT226, IT279, and IT327. Expanded below, I was a back end web developer for Discover Financial Services, where I worked primarily with Java and worked on web applicaitons.</pre>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Do you have any Database experience? (Used MS Access? Oracle? Comfortable with SQL?) If so, from what course(s)?
                    <pre>I am taking IT378 concurrently. I'm excited to be a part of both IT353 and IT378, because I can tie together a lot of knowledge to become a better web developer for my team this summer. In a previous job in high school, I worked with an MS Access DB. Interestingly enough, my small school of 300+ kids was using a rather insecure DB to contain all the usernames and passwords of the students and faculty. Learned a great deal though. </pre>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Do you have any Web development experience? (Built any pages? Used any web development technologies before? etc.) If so,
                    from what course(s)?
                </li>
                <pre>I do have some Web development experience. I spent last summer at Discover Financial Services as a back end web developer. Though mainly I worked on back end security validation, I worked with Restful web services, and learned about the MVC pattern. I spent a lot of time learning to use IBM Websphere, the application server hosting the services. I'm really hoping to become more comfortable and capable in web development, so I very much look forward to this class.</pre>

                    <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-mashups/index.html" rel="nofollow">Mashups: The new breed of Web app</a>
                </li>
                <pre>This article covers the idea of mashing two different technologies, citing similarities to music and borrowing the term where two different songs will be mashed together. This article covers many different use cases for this concept, such as Mapping, video/photo, news, and shopping mashups.

This article explains that in mashups, multiple providers of content are involved, not just the core website itself. (Google maps being embedded in another site means that Google is now a content provider in that embedded site).

The article explains multiple technologies that help support mashups, and the technical challenges that are involved in intergrated multiple providers in one site. Such that the mashup site must ensure that the content is consistent and usable within. The article has an important discussion on how there must be clear emphasis on security, privacy and quality for the users.

                </li>
                <pre>When internet searching and indexing exploded, there was an unbelievable amount of people and companies trying their hardest to make their site appear as the number one search result on Google. This article details an occurance where general search results seem to always point to the "J.C. Penney" store website. Though they never openly admitted it, It was discovered that "J.C. Penney" had been exploiting the Google PageRank algorithm, by having links to their store scattered across the web in completely unrelated websites. Google strongly opposes this practice, and they will punish any site by restricting the rank of their site if they are caught performing this exploit.

I wrote a paper in IT279 covering the Google PageRank algorithm, how it worked, how people tried to game the algorithm unsuccessfully, and somehow missed this story of a large corporation successfully pulling it off. So instead of making it easy for people to shop online and becoming the best retailer, their hired web marketing agency cheated. Not a good look J.C. Penney.

                            And it is an elegant solution because it will disappear automatically when the user starts typing.

                            div and css to create the capture for my dog chasing its tail, but HTML5 adds native support
                            for image captions, which made things really simple to insert a picture and a caption. Not a
                            whole lot of messing with css required.

                            and reusability, especially since now it's as simple as one line of code. Before this tag I'm
                            sure it was much more difficult to achieve this effect.

                How the web works (
                <a href="http://mkcohen.com/how-the-web-works-in-one-easy-lesson">basic</a> vs
                <a href="http://igoro.com/archive/what-really-happens-when-you-navigate-to-a-url/">detailed</a>)

            <pre>The second article elaborates more on the idea on the "web servers" that obtain the IP addresses. The second article talks about the DNS lookup process, and in order of which the browser will try to obtain the site you are looking for.

Another interesting tidbit about the second is that it explains that for popular sites, there isn't just one IP address. The reasons given are that one IP address would become a bottleneck, a central point of access for everyone in the world to try and use. Which can slow down the process

The article explains that the IP address given to the user is based on a number of factors, such as geographic location (closest to the user), load, or round robin where multiple are given.

Another important part of how the web works that is much more explained in the second article is the specified type of HTTP request, and how it matters.

                What is a Web (Application) Framework? Name 3 examples of this.
            </li>
            <pre>A web application framework is a framework that will help developers build web applications. Web applications are built to allow users to perform certain actions, like Google search. The user provides an input to the web application, and the web application will do some sort of process and return the results to the user. Or if you check your email at Outlook, you are interacting with an application to display and manage your email.

A framework is simply something that allows you to build such applications easier. They can provide tools and libraries that eliminate repetitive code and simplify tasks. I have some experience using Java Spring, which is a Model-View-Controller architecture based framework. 

A couple examples of this would be the increasingly popular "Ruby on rails", "Bootstrap", and "Java Spring."

                What does ARIA stand for? What problem of the Web does it address, and how does it do it?
            </li>
            <pre>ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. ARIA is a set of attributes that helps enhance your web site or application to be more helpful to accessibility software. This is a standard that was set by W3C in 2014 to start maintaining sites that are more inclusive to people with disabilities. I'm personally aware of one program called JAWS that is very popular among visually impaired users. Without these standards, it makes it harder for that program to understand where to read text, in what order, what is important, etc. It also allows users to be able to use your site without a mouse. In fact, Google is one site that is compliant with these standards. Next time you visit Google, try to navigate with only key commands. It's actually made easier than you think.

This is done via special ARIA attributes that point things out to screen readers or give information to screen readers, like an ARIA attribute that tells the screen reader that an input is required, and the screen reader can inform the user that they should enter the required information.

                What is search engine optimization (SEO) and why is it important?
            </li>
            <pre>Search engine optimization is a methodology of improving your site so Google or Bing can easily scan your website. There are a number of factors that can help optimize your site so that you can be properly indexed by search engines.
                
Some key ideas are making sure you have a clear URL that have the right words you want to be associated with. This also applies to headers, adding specific key words, etc. You can also optimize your site so it can be more easily indexed by Google and Bing, increasing the chances of getting a higher position on the search results page.
